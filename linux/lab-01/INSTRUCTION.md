# LAB 01

This lab focus on setting up a Linux environement on top of Windows using *Windows Subsystem for Linux* and executing Linux basic commands within that environment.

More information about WSL here : https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/06/15/wsl-file-system-support/

## Install and run Windows Subsystem for Linux

*Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)* provides a Linux environement on your Windows computer and can be installed using the following PowerShell cmdlets :

0. Open a PowerShell session as administrator

1. Enable WSL Windows feature (will require reboot)

```PowerShell
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux"
```

2. After reboot, Open a PowerShell session as administrator and install Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distribution

```PowerShell
> New-Item -path "c:\" -name "distro" -ItemType "directory"
> Set-Location C:\distro\
> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804" -OutFile "Ubuntu.appx" -UseBasicParsing
> Rename-Item "Ubuntu.appx" "Ubuntu.zip"
> Expand-Archive "Ubuntu.zip"
> Remove-Item "Ubuntu.zip"
> $userenv = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
> [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $userenv + ";C:\distro\Ubuntu", "User")
```

3. Instantiate and run Ubuntu

```bash
> ubuntu1804.exe
```

This will instantiate Ubuntu (can take a few minutes), you will be prompted to create a user name and password. From there you will be presented a **bash** prompt. The Linux distribution can either be started from **CMD** or **PowerSHell** or be launching the exe from explorer which will start a dedicated window.

## Prepare SSH credentials

1. Create the ".ssh" directory with **mkdir**, verify its default permissions with **ls** and change them to "rwx------" using **chmod**. Then show the result with **ls** (this step is only for lab purpose as the .ssh dir is created by ssh-keygen if it does not exist).

2. Generate a SSH key pair with the default value for the path and no password (since you're Linux environment is not shared) then List the content of the ~/.ssh directory and verify the permissions on the key files.

## Download an Azure Linux VM template

1. Create a target directory for the template with **mkdir** and change current working directory to that new directory using **cd**.

2. Look for template files containing a Azure Linux VM template and its parameters.

3. Display the *template parameter* file with **cat** and the *template* with **less** and search for occurences of "securityRules".

## Edit an Azure VM template

Edit an Azure VM template to perform the following modification :

1. Modify the *template* file using **nano** to enable inbound TCP22 for your public IP address.

2. Change the "UserIndex" to your trainee index and add your SSH public key to the *template parameter* file using **vim** to open both files at the same time and using the split screen feature.

## Install Azure Cli

Install Azure Cli, following official documentation. The installation consist of adding the Microsoft *GPG* signing key to the trusted ones and add the **Azure Cli** distribution specific repository url to the list of available repository for **apt**.

```Bash
$ curl -sL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc.gpg > /dev/null
$ AZ_REPO=$(lsb_release -cs)
$ echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ $AZ_REPO main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install azure-cli
```

## Update packages

Elevate using **sudo** to update package list with **apt**. Inspect the list of packages availabale for upgrade and upgrade them all.
