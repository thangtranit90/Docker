## LINUX vs WINDOWS

### concepts & terminology

![lindows](src/lindows.png)

### Linux diversity

**Linux** was originally developed by **Linus Torvalds** based on **Minix** for the kernel and the **GNU** project for user space (applications, tools, services). Linux has now many distribution with each its subsequent flavors.

The mains distributions include :
* **Debian** based, including Ubuntu
* **Slackware** based including SuSE
* **RedHat** based including CentOS and Fedora
* **Arch Linux**
* **Android**

## BASIC COMMANDS

### **basic file/directory operations & permissions**

* In Linux systems, every access divides into three categories, owner, groups or world
* Permissions are none (**-**), read (**r**), write (**w**), execute (**x**) granted for owner/user (**u**), Group (**g**), and world/others (**o**).
* Permissions are displayed in four parts :
    * **Type**: first digit (‘**-**’ for file, ‘**d**’ for dir, ‘**l**’ for link…)
    * **Owner** : three digits (r--, rw-, rwx, r-x…)
    * **Group** : three digits (r--, rw-, rwx, r-x…)
    * **World** : three digits (r--, rw-, rwx, r-x…)
* Permissions are modified using two syntax, symbolic or octal where **4** is read, **2** is write and **1** is execute.
    * **Symbolic** : chmod uo+x, g-w file
    * **Octal** : chmod 755 file
* Access is granted based on sequential evaluation:
    * Is the user owner of the file > apply owner permissions
    * Is the user part of the group > apply group permission
    * The user does meet previous criteria > apply world permissions
* The **umask** is a filter expressed in octal which removes some permissions from the ones inherited when creating files and directories (ex: 0666 – 0002 = 0664)
* Linux also implement POSIX compliant ACLs

### **help, permission elevation, remoting & power management**

* Help can be found in the Linux “manual pages” using **‘man’** tool or in the “GNU info system”, which is structured with links, using **‘info’** tool.
* Linux provide **‘su** and **‘sudo’** commands to “run as” a different user, in general root for privilege elevation.
* **‘su’** (substitute user) is usually used to “run as” root **a new shell** until the shell is exited. It requires to know **root password** so it **should be avoided**.
* **‘sudo’** is usually used to “run as” root **a single command** using **current user’s password** (subsequent sudo wont prompt for the next 15mn)
* ‘sudo’ is configured on a per user basis with files located in **‘/etc/sudoers.d/’** (main user configured by default on Ubuntu).
* Power control of the system is managed by **‘shutdown’** and require elevated privileges.
* On Ubuntu, **‘shutdown’** with no options (such as “now”) does not shutdown the system but switch to single user mode (run level 1 or recovery mode with filesystem mounted)
* **SSH** use both public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption) for authentication and secret keys (symmetric encryption) for traffic encryption.
* SSH keys on client are stored by default in **‘/home/[user]/.ssh/’** including private key **‘id_rsa’** and public key **‘id_rsa.pub’**
* User’s SSH public key must be stored on remote server(s) in **‘/home/[user]/.ssh/authorized_keys’**
* When connecting the first time to a server, a warning is displayed to accept the connection and add the server’s public host key in **‘/home/[user]/.ssh/known-hosts’** (this is not the user’s public key but the server’s host key ‘ssh_host_rsa_key.pub’)
* SSH support **multiple authentication protocols** in addition to pub/priv key, including Kerberos and basic (password : which might be disabled)

## PACKAGE MANAGER

* Responsible for installation, upgrade, configuration, integrity check, removal of packages in an automated and predictable fashion
* Two types of package managers, **low level** and **high level**
* Low level utilities such as **rpm** and **dpkg** list, install, update or remove packages without managing dependencies other than warn.
* High level utilities such as **yum** and **apt** resolve dependencies on top of low level utilities:
    * Install automatically dependencies
    * Prompt for aborting or removing dependencies which might be used by other packages
* High level utilities rely on database to find available packages for installation or update. Database source can be both local or remote repositories
* Individual **apt-get** and **apt-cache** commands are now being replaced by a unique **apt** command
* Both low level and high level package manager can **remove** or **purge** packages. Purging will delete configuration files.

![Boot sequence](src/linuxBoot.png)

*Most common partition table types are GPT and classic MBR (sometimes referred to as DOS)

## STORAGE

### **filesystem hierarchy & fstab**

![filesystem](src/filesystem.png)

* Everything is a file in Linux including devices and processes
* System runtime artefacts (ex: processes, memory, interrupts…) are presented as file using in memory virtual **pseudo filesystem**
* Special “fake” device for special use :
    * /dev/null > discard data written to the device and return EOF on read
    * /dev/zero > discard data written to the device and generate zeros on read
    * /dev/loop[n] > Loopback device created from files
    * …
* The entire **filesystem tree** can **spread across** multiple volumes (disks, partitions, network storage, files/loop device) with different format mounted at different mount points (directories) of the tree
* Linux has a standard hierarchy, BUT with lots of history and exceptions (ex: /var/run kept for retro-compatibility)
* Mount points can also map to an image file (loopback device) or file/folder (bind-mounts)
* Persistent mount points configuration: **/etc/fstab**

### **Logical Volume Management & RAID**

![LVM](src/lvm.png)

* Leverage LVM for flexibility by creating logical volumes which span multiple disks and can be resized (overhead on performance and partition type “8e”)
* Leverage RAID for performance or redundancy setup (partition type “fd”)

$ mkdir /data /backup
$ sudo mount /dev/vg1/lv1 /data 
$ sudo mount /dev/vg1/lv2 /backup
$ df -h
```

*Unmount the volume before and resize the volume’s filesystem after

## NETWORK

* The **hostname** of a Linux host is defined in **/etc/hostname** and can be printed or modified temporarily using **hostname** command or persistently using **hostnamectl**
* The **HOSTS** files in Linux is located in **/etc/hosts** and is used for the same purpose as in Windows systems
* If not configured automatically through DHCP, DNS servers are defined manually in /**etc/resolv.conf**
* Tools such as **ip** and **ifconfig** do not make changes persistent, to persist those changes use **Network Manager** (**nmtui**/**nmcli**)
* In **Azure** network interface properties and route configuration is rarely modified at guest OS level but is managed though **integrated DHCP** and **User Defined Route (UDR)**
* **iptables** is kernel module (subset of the Netfilter framework) applying routing and filtering to network packets, it is managed though the **iptables** command line.
* **iptables** is also extensively used for VMs and containers networking
* **Firewalld** is a more dynamic alternatives (still relying on iptables commands and * Netfilter framework) based on zones and not requiring firewall restart when modifying rules
* In **Azure** network security is rarely configured at guest OS level but is managed through **Network Security Groups (NSG)** and/or **Network Virtual Appliances (NVA)**

## SYSTEM ACTIVITY

### **processes, daemons & resources**

* Processes are instances of one or multiple related tasks (threads) scheduled and managed by the kernel to access computer resources required for execution. Systemd is now the standard to perform **init** function and control the processes
* The first user process to launch is **init** with PID = 1
* Processes are of different types :
    * **Interactive** : foreground process started by a user
    * **Batch** : Background process scheduled from a terminal or cron for a short period to perform a specific task
    * **Daemons** : Background process usually launch at startup and running continuously waiting to “serve”
    * **Thread** : Task running under a main process
    * **Kernel thread** : Kernel space tasks managed by the kernel
* Processes are identified by 
    * **PID** : process ID
    * **PPID** : parent process ID
    * **TID** : thread ID (same as PID for single-threaded process)
    * **RUID** : real user ID identify the user who started it
    * **RGID** : real group ID identify the group who started it
* Orphan processes (whose parent died) or zombie processes (whose exit code was not handled properly) are adopted by **init** or **kthreadd** turning PPID to 1 or 2 before they are **“reaped”**.
* Process states include running, sleeping/waiting, stopped or zombie.
* Process priority is based on their ‘nice’ value which range from -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest priority)

#### Commands

|           | PROCESS MANAGEMENT                                                                               |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ps        | Show processes ()                                                                                |
| pstree    | Show process tree (‘a’ to show parameter and ‘p’ to show PID)                                    |
| killall   | Equivalent to ‘kill’ command to send signals to processes such as SIGKILL to terminate a process |
| systemctl | Start, stop, query and configure processes managed by Systemd (‘q’ to quit)                      |

#### Exemples

```
$ ps -elf
$ ps -auxf
$ pstree -p
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null &
$ pstree -p
$ killall -SIGKILL dd
$ systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
$ systemctl status lxd-containers.service
$ sudo systemctl restart lxd-containers.service
$ systemctl status lxd-containers.service
$ sudo systemctl disable lxd-containers.service
```

### **monitoring and logging**

* Linux distributions provides various tools to monitoring on going system activity and resource consumptions. On of the “top” in mind is actually called **top**.
* Logging of events in Linux append in the  **/var/log** directory
* The main Linux journals are the following :
    * Security logs : Authentication related events are contained in **/var/log/secure** or **/var/log/auth.log** on Debian based systems
    * System logs :
        * Kernel specific events: **/var/log/kern.log**
        * General system events: **/var/log/messages** or **/var/log/syslog** on Debian based systems

#### Commands

|        |MONITORING                                                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| top    | Real time display of process activities and their compute resource utilization (‘q’ to quit) |
| iotop  | Real time display of process activities and their storage resource utilization (‘q’ to quit) |
| uptime | Show system uptime since the last boot                                                       |
| iostat | Shows per storage device I/O statistics (‘-k’ for stats in kilobytes and ‘-m’ for megabytes) |

#### Exemples

```
$ top
$ sudo iotop
$ uptime
$ iostat -k
```

### **service creation**

Traditionally with SystemV, a daemon required a startup script ([ServiceName]) with a specific format to be located under **‘/etc/init.d/**’ and starting a script or a binary usually located in **’/usr/sbin’**

```
#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          sudo
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs
# Required-Stop:
# X-Start-Before:    rmnologin
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:
# Short-Description: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users
# Description: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users.
### END INIT INFO
. /lib/lsb/init-functions
N=/etc/init.d/sudo
set -e
case "$1" in
  start)
        # make sure privileges don't persist across reboots
        if [ -d /var/lib/sudo ]
        then
                find /var/lib/sudo -exec touch -d @0 '{}' \;
        fi
        ;;
  stop|reload|restart|force-reload|status)
        ;;
  *)
        echo "Usage: $N {start|stop|restart|force-reload|status}" >&2
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
exit 0
```

Systemd daemon startup scripts ([serviceName].service) have a much simpler content and are now under **‘/etc/systemd/system’** and still starting a script or a binary usually located in **’/usr/sbin’**

```
[Unit]
Description=OpenBSD Secure Shell server
After=network.target auditd.service
ConditionPathExists=!/etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/ssh
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/sshd -D $SSHD_OPTS
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=sshd.service
```

## LOCAL IDENTITY MANAGEMENT

* Users are defined and configured in **‘/etc/passwd’** file :
    * **User name**
    * **User password hash** (usually **‘x’**)
    * **User ID** (UID), user IDs under 1000 are considered special system users
    * **Group ID** (GID)
    * **GECOS information** used to various contact info (full name, email…)
    * **Home directory**
    * **Default shell**
* For security reason the password hash is never defined in **‘/etc/passwd’** but a **‘x’** indicate that is it defined in **‘/etc/shadow’**
    * **User name**
    * **User password hash** (‘!’ or ‘!!’ if user is locked or newly created, **‘*’** if non interactive users such as bin or daemon)
    * **Lastchange** : age of the password in days since 01/01/1970
    * **Mindays** : minimum password age before it can be changed
    * **Maxdays** : maximum password age before next change
    * **Warn** : number of days before password expiration to warn the user
    * **Grace** : number of days after password expiration to disable the account
    * **Expire** : date at which the account will be disabled
    * **Reserved** : no purpose yet defined
* Groups are defined and configured in **‘/etc/group’**
* User, password and group configuration files should not be edited directly but using related tool (usermod, useradd…)
* By default each new user is associated a new group (a User Private Group) with the same name and generally the same ID as UID
* User can be added to up to 15 secondary security groups
* Default new user settings are defined in **‘/etc/default/useradd’** and default home directory content for new user is in **‘/etc/skel/’**
